EyeScary development has three current members: Jasper Cayley (Co-Founder) (https://github.com/thebookcheese), Wilbur Williams (Not Co-Founder) (https://github.com/ThisCatLikesCrypto), and Peter (Co-Founder) Rimmer (https://github.com/pittab).
We are a small development group mainly just experimenting with development and working together to create some random things.
