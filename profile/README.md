EyeScary development has three current members: Peter Rimmer (https://pittab.neocities.org), Wilbur Williams (https://wilburwilliams.uk) and Jasper Cayley (https://jasperweb.pages.dev)  
We are a small development group mainly just experimenting with development and working together to create some random things.
