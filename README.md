## Ever wanted to see the backend of a programming language? Or have vim but with bongo from emacs? Now you can! We make weird projects like these, such as:

- [x] A text adventure in 2024  
- [x] Another interpreted, learn-to-code, simple programming language (that goes through 2 layers of interpretation because yes, write your interpreter in python)  
- [x] Vim but with music in the background
- [x] And a website that looks like it came out of 2010, nice!
